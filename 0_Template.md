## Description

This document is the template starter for all Treetop Lessons. Below, the structure, format, and syntactic conventions of a typical coding lesson will be covered. In addition, notes will be provided to you, the instructor, on how to best educate your student.

## Philosophy

All of the content of Treetop Learning lessons is backed by modern paedological practices, and has been carefully review by peers.

Treetop Learning lessons follow the [Backwards Design](https://www.modelteaching.com/education-articles/lesson-curriculum-planning/backwards-design-in-lesson-planning) standards for curriculum design, which comprimises three steps:

1. Establishing learning objectives
2. Determining evidence of achievement
3. Configuring learning materials

Above all, the Backwards Design philosophy prioritizes that instructors teach with the **desired learning outcome in mind**, rather than attempting to simply cover a wide range of concepts. It is important when you are teaching a lesson to follow the structure that each lesson specification (or "lesson spec") covers. This doesn't mean that you should say every word provided, but rather, you should teach in a way that is consistent with the principles of Backwards Design, which will be explained in each lesson.

## **Phase One: Objectives**

For practice purposes, in this lesson the instructor will play the role of both the student and and the instructor. In the objectives, you will be provided with the focus questions, and often the the thematic focuses of the lesson. The learning objectives for this lesson spec are the following:

> **Tip:** It's reccomended that you check through each objective as needed to ensure all lesson goals are met.

<input type="checkbox"> The instructor can name all three phases of Backward Design.

<input type="checkbox"> The instructor understands the differences between all three phases of Backward Design.

<input type="checkbox"> The instructor is aware that all instruction is to be done with the desired outcome in mind.

As the instructor, it is your duty to ensure that the student is able to meet each of these standards at the end of their lesson. Often times, Phase One will include extended descriptions of content to be taught. While all information is likely to be used during the lesson by the instructor, it is up the the instructor's discretion to include and exclude necessary pieces of content. Remember, the goal of Backwards Design is not to cover a wide range of curriculum at a surface level, but rather, coach your student to a level where they will be able to demonstrate content mastery through an interactive assessment.

## **Phase Two: Activities**

Now that you have instructed your student on what they are going to learn about, it is time to utilize Treetop software to get some practice.

There are several basic practice activities. They are as follows:

> **Tip:** It's most beneficial if the student works out the solution on their own before you provide the solution. Backwards Design principles only apply to the overall lesson goals, not to individual practice problems.

### **Complete the function**

```python
# Complete the following function, which prints 'Hello World' when called.

func hello_world():
    ## Enter code here

```

<details>
<summary> Solution</summary>

```python
print('Hello World')
```

</details>

### **Write the function**

```python
# Define a function that takes in a parameter input, doubles that parameter, and then returns the result

# Enter code here
```

<details>
<summary> Solution</summary>

```python
func double(input):
    return input * 2
```

</details>

### **Trace the code**

```python
# There is an error in the following function. Trace the code and report the error.

func divide(input):
    return input / 0

```

<details>
<summary> Solution</summary>

```python
ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero
```

</details>

## **Phase Three: Assessment**

The final portion of each lesson will be the assessment. The methodology for assessing students' ability to be able to apply what they learned during the lesson will vary. Though, as an instructor you will be expected to go back to the critical questions of the lesson.

> **Tip:** Assessments often will often span the material of multiple lessons, and instead be given as benchmarks for student progress. Don't get too caught up if your student is struggling with a concept after the lesson has ended, as there will be extended practice and more exposure to the
